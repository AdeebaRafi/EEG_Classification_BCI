# EEG_Classification_BCI
This project explores how brain signals (EEG) can be used to recognize imagined movements like left hand, right hand, both feet, and tongue. The work is based on the BCI Competition IV, Dataset 2a, where participants wore an EEG cap with 22 electrodes to record brain activity.
